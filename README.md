# pfe-upload-student-list
This app was created to allow users working on an existing J2EE app to appload a list a students on a time. The existing J2EE app don't allow this option, so students are added one by one to the DB.
The students use a Google form to provide presonnal informations to the administration that use the app to manage final internships in the ISET Bizerte University.
The admin dispose of a Google Sheets file containing the registred students. This file must be converted to a JSON file before using this solution to upload the content to the MySQL DB.
